  # Some systems provide more than one type of (SoX-compatible)
  # audio driver, e.g. ALSA & OSS, or SUNAU & AO. Systems can
  # also have more than one audio device (a.k.a. `sound card').
  # If more than one audio driver has been built-in to SoX, and
  # the default selected by SoX when recording or playing is not
  # the one that is wanted, then the AUDIODRIVER environment
  # variable can be used to override the default.

  # The AUDIODEV environment variable can be used to override the
  # default audio device
  AUDIODEV='hw:0'
  # Gives the sample rate in Hz (or kHz if appended with 'k') of the file.
  # For an input file, the most common use for this option is to
  # inform SoX of the sample rate of a 'raw' ('headerless') audio
  # file (see the examples in -b and -c above). Occasionally it may
  # be useful to use this option with a 'headered' file, in order to
  # override the (presumably incorrect) value in the header—note
  # that this is only supported with certain file types. For example,
  # if audio was recorded with a sample-rate of say 48k from a source
  # that played back a little, say 1. 5%, too slowly

  # The number of bits (a.k.a. bit-depth or sometimes word-length) in
  # each encoded sample.  Not applicable to complex encodings such as
  # MP3 or GSM. Not necessary with encodings that have a fixed number of
  # bits, e.g. A/μ-law, ADPCM.
  # For an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform 
  # SoX of the number of bits per sample in a `raw' (`headerless') audio 
  # file.
  # For an output file, this option can be used (perhaps along with -e)
  # to set the output encoding size.  By default (i.e. if this option 
  # is not given), the output encoding size will (providing it is supported
  # by the output file type) be set to the input encoding size.
  BITS=16
  # The number of audio channels in the audio file. This can be any number
  # greater than zero.
  # For an input file, the most common use for this option is to inform SoX
  # of the number of channels in a `raw' (`headerless') audio file.
  # Occasionally, it may be useful to use this option with a `headered'
  # file, in order to override the (presumably incorrect) value in the
  # header—note that this is only supported with certain file types.
  # For an output file, this option provides a shorthand for specifying 
  # that the channels effect should be invoked in order to change (if necessary) 
  # the number of channels in the audio signal to the number given.
